## About me
---
I'm a frontend developer who never stops coding. I set goals for myself, in the course of which i learn new useful technologies. I like working with React, working with state managment Redux, add typing using TypeScript, send requests to the server and analyze their responses. Also i write documentation about extensions/programming languages for myself and run GitHub, noting my progress. I admire Frontend development so much that I can't tear myself away from it. I like to find mistakes and fix them. I believe that it is from mistakes that we learn. I am always open to new challenges and I like to solve non-standard tasks. I love learning something new and developing in my stack, and I'm always happy to help colleagues.

## Code Example
---
__Stop gninnipS My sdroW!__   
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

My code:
```js
function spinWords(string){
    return string.split(" ").map(word => {
        if (word.length >= 5) {
            return word.split("").reverse().join("");
        }
        
        return word;
    }).join(" ");
}
```
